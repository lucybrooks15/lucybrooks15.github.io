               My name is Lucy Brooks. I grew up in Mangawhai, a small beach town up north.
               This really allowed me to appreciate the environment and the creative 
               culture there. Moving to Auckland 6 years ago let me expand on
               this as the city was very different culturally and had more
               opportunities. Painting and drawing has always been a passion of
               mine since I was young and I started to understand and love design
               in high school.
